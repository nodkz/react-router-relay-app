However, two technologies have emerged from Microsoft, the Task Parallel Library, and the less common but emerging technology, the Reactive Extensions for .NET. Which should developers be using? Does Task and async/await replace Rx? In fact, the best answer is, \"Use both!\" This talk will describe how Task and Rx's IObservable can be used together to produce truly elegant, functional, and far more testable code than using either technology in isolation. Through plenty of code examples, we'll see how to use Rx to test and mock Task methods, how to write LINQ'y async code, and when to use Rx Zen Nature and when to use Task Zen Nature.</p>",
